**Assignment** | | 
Variables | `y = 1` | `var y = 1;`
Constants | `Y = 1` | `const Y = 1;`
Many at once | `x, y = 1, 2` | `var x = 1, y = 2;`
with unpacking / destructuring | . | `var [x, y] = [1, 2]` 
**unpacking** | | 
Swap | `x, y = y, x` | `[x, y] = [y, x];
First & Rest | `head, *tails = xs` | `` 
First, Last, Middle | `head, *middles, tail = xs` |
